    </header>
    <p>This app is for those who are interested in traveling to European cities, but want to know more about them first. The primary target group are people from outside Europe, since they might not be as familiar with the different locations. This is why the detailed view of a city includes a URL to its corresponding Wikipedia article, which provides extensive information about it.</p>
